### Projects

* **CocoaPods**
	The dependency manager for Cocoa projects. Acting as a core team member since April of 2014, I have worked on versions 0.32.0 to 0.39.0, adding support for tvOS and watchOS, improving Xcode project creation by reversing and utilizing the private DevToolsCore framework and helped with shipping support for Swift. I have also helped organizing events, represented the project with talks at multiple conferences and onboarded new members into the project, e.g. by mentoring our 2015 Rails Girls Summer of Code team.

* **xcode-install**
	CLI tool for downloading, installing and managing Xcode. To ease the installation of multiple versions of Xcode side by side, especially during the beta periods, I created this project in April 2015. Since then it has been adopted by numerous iOS teams, attracted a few returning contributors and has seen the release of its 1.0 in October.

* **Xcode Plugins**
	I have created several popular Xcode plugins, like *BBUDebuggerTuckAway* which automatically hides the debugger when typing inside the source code editor or *BBUFullIssueNavigator* which improves the display of errors and warnings inside the issue navigator. With numerous talks, blog posts and contributions to the plugin manager *Alcatraz*, I have also helped many others to start improving their workflows with their own plugins.
